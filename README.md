# Learning Front End Development Bookmarks

This site is a collection of boomkarks for learning front end develpment. I am still in the process of learning and needed a cental place to display all the articles, books, web sites, frameworks, code snippets and many other types of relevant information. Plus, I also wanted to created a bootstrap Jekyll theme.
