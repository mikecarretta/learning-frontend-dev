# Learning Front End Development Bookmarks

This site is a collection of bookmarks for learning front end development. I am still in the process of learning and needed a central place to display all the articles, books, web sites, frameworks, code snippets and many other types of relevant information. Plus, I also wanted to created a bootstrap Jekyll theme.
