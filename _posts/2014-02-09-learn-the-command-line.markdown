Learning to use and get comfortable with the Command Line is very important to learning front end development. This post is a collections of resources and snippets.

The **[Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/ "Command Line Crash Course")** is a beginner level overview of the command line (CL) and is a great starting point. The course takes one to two days and make sure to practice and type all of his exercies

## Basic Overview

The BASH prompt is where you enter your commands. I use the ` $ ` to denote the end of the prompt, ` ~ ` is the home directory, ` clear ` puts the command prompt at the top of the screen, and press the arrow up key to add the last command typed.

### Common Commands

* ` $ pwd ` Print working directory

* ` $ mkdir ` Make a directory folders

* ` $ mkdir -p LoremIpsum/dolor/sit `  Will make an entire path

* ` $ cd ` Change directory, ` $ cd .. `move back one directory, ` $ cd ~ ` move to the home directory

* ` cd <drag folder to terminal> `

* ` $ ls ` list directory, ` $ ls -lr ` list direct with details, ` $ ls -l ` long form, ` ls -a ` list all

* ` $ touch ` create an empty file, ` $ touch index.html ` create an empty file named index.html

* ` $ cp ` Copy a file, ` $ cp lorem.html ipsum.html `

* ` $ mv ` move a file or rename, ` $ cp old-file.html new-file.html `

* ` $ rm ` remove a file, ` $ rm new-file.html `

* ` $ rmdir ` remove directory, ` rmdir LoremIpsum `
